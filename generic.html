										Beauty is our DNA. From the very first hair dye L’Oréal produced in 1909 to our innovative Beauty Tech products and services today, our company has been a pure player and leader in the beauty sector worldwide for decades.</p>
									<p>We believe that beauty, the quest for beauty, unites us all. It is a fundamental need that goes beyond mere “appearance” and taps deep into human aspirations: a sense of belonging, self-realization, self-confidence... We strive to help women and men all over the world fulfill these aspirations, while understanding and respecting all the nuances in cultures, needs and traditions.</p>
									<p>And so our mission is to offer to all women and men on the planet the best of beauty in terms of quality, efficacy, safety and responsibility. With such strong foundations, we conceive and build an infinite diversity of beauty products and services – in order to share the best of beauty with everyone, everywhere.</p>

											<h3>Contributing to solving the challenges of the world</h3>
											<p>Over the past years, expectations as to what the role of companies should be have changed dramatically. At L’Oréal, we want to take on greater responsibility, go beyond the mere transformation of our business model. With our new sustainability program, we want to demonstrate that companies can be part of the solution to some of today’s most pressing environmental and social challenges.</p>
											<p>For this reason, we are allocating 100 million euros to impact investing dedicated to the regeneration of ecosystems and the development of the circular economy, and 50 million euros to a charitable endowment fund to support highly vulnerable women.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>About L’Oréal’s sustainability commitments: we are not starting from scratch</h3>
											<p>Very early on, L’Oréal became aware of the need to respond to environmental challenges. As an industrial company, it decided that tackling the environmental impact of its factories and distribution centers was the most obvious first step, and a necessary one, to begin its transformation process.</p>

									<h2>For The people</h2>
									<p>To us, the way we do business is just as important as financial performance, and that includes how we work with our teams, our partners and the communities we interact with. We are committed to fairness and ethics in all aspects of human relations, and the L’Oréal Spirit places special emphasis on diversity and inclusion.</p>
									<p>The people we are working with are a wealth without which L’Oréal would not be what it is today. So we are doing all we can to make sure our partners and employees can develop to their fullest potential, through education, training, mentorships and numerous initiatives designed to help them thrive at every level.</p>
									<p>We have a special focus on empowering women, who represent half of the world. Women have a major role in reshaping the future of Beauty.</p>
